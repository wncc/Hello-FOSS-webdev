# Hello-FOSS-webdev

This is the official website for WnCC's Hello-FOSS festival. 

Hello There!   

Hello FOSS is a *festival* organised by [WnCC](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/), IITB and [DevCom](http://devcom-iitb.org/), IITB to encourage the culture of Open Source in our insti. We promise there's something for everyone. Okay, time for some background before getting started.    
There's this initiative called [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) by Digital Ocean all over the world to encourage participation in the open source community. There's a challenge, on whose completion they award you with a limited edition tshirt and schwag. We wanted to help y'all get started with Open Source, but given the academic load this semester, thought that now might not be a good time. But, with Hacktoberfest running along side, we hope your enthusiasm to learn Open Source fueled by the motivation to complete this year's challenge, this might turn out to be a successful endeavour afterall.

Open Source can be daunting at first, How would I get started? Will they accept me? Will ..anyone accept me?
